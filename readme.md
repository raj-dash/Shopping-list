# Shopping List Project

This is a project that I've made while learning vanilla JavaScript.

- You can add items to the list by entering text into the text box and clicking on "Add item" or pressing enter
- You can remove specific items by clicking on the red cross icon
- You can also remove all items by clicking on the "Clear All" button
- Items on the list can be edited by clicking on the item you wish to edit, changed and then the updated using the update button
- Items can be filtered through using the filter input. Items are filtered in real time as you input text.

_Note_: The items are stored locally and are accessed every time you open the website, ensuring that as long as you use thge same device, your list will remain intact
